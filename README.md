# Payroll-Tracker


## Description
 This is my payroll tracker I have been working on. I was given starter code to work on and I have added inputs and arrays to collect the input data on. This project is still a work in progress and I am proud of the progress I have made. I cannot wait to make more changes in the future. Where inputs display on a  calculated table!


## Credits
I used MDN a lot for my research and some of my Javascript commands
