# payroll-tracker

## In this project I made changes to a starter code of a website. I worked with javascript to create a payroll tracker. At the time of making this I have not fully finished it. However I have made a way to track the inputs of the names and the numbers put in. They are stored in arrays. I am very proud of the work I have done. It took a lot of time and effort. I look forward to updating this project in the future
